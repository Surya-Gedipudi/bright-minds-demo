# bright-minds-demo
This was the initial idea of the website for Bright Minds. This is NOT complete at all, this was just a beginning idea/scrap to see what the general layout of Bright Minds could look like. This was just to organize the different sections/thoughts/ideas behind the website design. It is currently being designed using React and TypeScript.
